    "## R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. It is a commonly used measure of goodness of fit for linear regression models and provides an indication of how well the model fits the observed data.\n",
    "## The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that none of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s) and 1 indicates that all of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s).\n",
    "## R-squared is calculated as the ratio of the explained variance (SSR) to the total variance (SST), where SSR is the sum of squares due to regression and SST is the total sum of squares. Mathematically, the formula for R-squared is:\n",
    "## R-squared = SSR/SST\n",
    "## where SSR = ∑(ŷi- ȳ)² and SST = ∑(yi- ȳ)², where ŷi is the predicted value of the dependent variable, ȳ is the mean of the dependent variable, and yi is the observed value of the dependent variable.\n",
    "## In general, a higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data. However, it is important to note that a high R-squared value does not necessarily mean that the model is a good predictor of future outcomes, as it may overfit the data. Therefore, it is important to use other diagnostic measures to assess the validity and reliability of the model."

    "## Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that takes into account the number of independent variables in the model. It provides a more accurate measure of goodness of fit than R-squared when the number of independent variables in the model is relatively large.\n",
    "## While R-squared represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s), adjusted R-squared adjusts for the number of independent variables in the model. It penalizes the addition of unnecessary independent variables that do not contribute to the improvement of the model's predictive ability. Adjusted R-squared can be calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "## Adjusted R-squared = 1 - [(1 - R-squared) * (n - 1) / (n - k - 1)]\n",
    "## where n is the sample size and k is the number of independent variables in the model.\n",
    "## The main difference between R-squared and adjusted R-squared is that the former tends to increase as additional independent variables are added to the model, regardless of whether they are relevant or not. On the other hand, adjusted R-squared tends to decrease as additional independent variables are added to the model, unless they significantly improve the fit of the model. Therefore, adjusted R-squared is generally considered to be a more reliable indicator of the goodness of fit of a model when the number of independent variables is large."

Lasso regularization is particularly useful in high-dimensional data sets where the number of features is much larger than the number of observations.\n",

    "## 1. They assume a linear relationship between the predictors and the response variable: Regularized linear models are based on the assumption that the relationship between the predictors and the response variable is linear. If the relationship is not linear, regularized linear models may not be the best choice for regression analysis.\n",
    "## 2. They can be sensitive to the choice of regularization parameter: The performance of regularized linear models depends on the choice of the regularization parameter. If the regularization parameter is too small, the model may overfit the data, and if it is too large, the model may underfit the data. Finding the optimal value for the regularization parameter can be challenging, and different values may be optimal for different datasets.\n",
    "## 3. They may not work well with highly correlated predictors: Regularized linear models can struggle when the predictors are highly correlated with each other. In this case, the model may have difficulty selecting the most important predictors, and the performance may suffer as a result.\n",
    "## 4. They may not be able to capture complex nonlinear relationships: Regularized linear models are based on linear regression, and they may not be able to capture complex nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the response variable. In such cases, more advanced nonlinear models may be required.\n",
    "## 5. They may not be able to handle missing or categorical data: Regularized linear models assume that the data is complete and that all predictors are numerical. If the data contains missing values or categorical predictors, special handling may be required.\n",
